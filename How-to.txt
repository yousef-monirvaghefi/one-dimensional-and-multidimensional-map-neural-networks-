How to use the implemented architectures:

1.	Load the input data into the inputdata array
2.	Load the output data into the outputdata array
3.	Write a for loop and send each datapoint to the backpropagation function and train the architecture
4.	Write a for loop and send each datapoint to the compute_output function and compute the RMSe
